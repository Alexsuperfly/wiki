## Settings
### Low Detail
Run in Low Detail mode, reducing memory usage. When enabled, ground decorations (like pebbles and grass), and some textures are turned off.
#### WARNING
Please note, Low Detail mode can cause some textures to not render or disappear (e.g. Seer's Rooftop Agility). Turning off this option will fix this.

### Hide lower planes
Disable rendering floors below you, this can drastically improve client performance in locations such as the Kourend Library and Sepulchre.
